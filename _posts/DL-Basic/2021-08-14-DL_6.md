# Computer Vision Applications  
## (Semantic Segmentation and Detection)    
<br>

### Semantic Segmentation    
* 이미지의 픽셀마다 분류  
* 모든 픽셀이 label을 가짐  
* 자율주행에 활용  
* Fully Convolutional Network  
	* This is how an ordinary CNN looks like  
		* graph  
	* This is a fully convolutional network  
		* convolutionalization(input output 출력이 같음)  
			* dense layer가 없음  
	* convolution layers enables a classification net to output a heat map  
		* output이 커지게되면 뒤에 spatial dimension이 커짐  
	* while FCN can run with inputs of any size, the output dimensions are typically reduced by subsampling  
	* need a way to connect the coarse output to the dense pixels(spatial dimension 늘리는 역할이 필요)  
	* Deconvolution (conv transpose)  
		* graph  
### Detection   
* R-CNN  
	* bounding box를 찾기  
	* extracts around 2000 region proposals(using Selective search)  
	* compute features for each proposal(using AlexNet)  
	* classifies with linear SVMs  
	* 문제 : bounding-box 200개 CNN 다 통과시켜야함    
* SPPNet  
	* image 전체를 CNN 한번만  
	* feature map에 해당하는 것만 뜯어오기  
* Fast R-CNN  
	* takes an input and a set of bouning boxes  
	* generated convolutional feature map  
	* each region, get a fixed length from ROI pooling  
	* Two outputs : class and bounding-box regressor  
* Faster R-CNN  
	* Region Proposal Network  
		* bouding-box 뽑는 것도 학습하자  
		* Anchor boxes : detection boxes with predefined sizes  
* YOLO  
	* extremely fast object detection algorithm  
	* simultaneously predicts multiple bounding boxes and class probabilities  
	* No explicit bounding-box sampling(compared with Faster R-CNN)  
	* given an image, YOLO divides it into SXS grid  
		* if the center of an object falls into the grid cell, that grid cell is responsible for detection  
	* Each cell predicts B bounding-boxes  
		* Each bounding-box predicts box refinement and confidence  
	* Each cell predicts C class probabilities  
	* In total, it becomes a tensor with SXS(B*5+C)) size  
		* SXS : Number of cells of the grid  
		* B*5 : bounding boxes with offsets (x,y,w,h) and confidence  
		* C : number of classes
